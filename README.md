# Blog

This is a straw-man application to demonstrate migration techniques.

It is not an actual, serious, blog.

My original presentation is the contents of the blog.  Load the Postgresql sql dump blog_dev.sql to get the presentation.

Have fun, you've been warned, etc. etc.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
